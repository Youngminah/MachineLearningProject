Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves.The primary aim is to allow the computers learn automatically without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.


## :memo: Introduction
It requires the mathmatical background related to Maching Learning and python skills in the development of applications for the visual recognition tasks. The development of applications are related to the visual recognition tasks in the deep neural network.


### What is Binary Classfication?

Binary or binomial classification is the task of classifying the elements of a given set into two groups (predicting which group each one belongs to) on the basis of a classification rule.


## :star2: What is the Key Point?
Any library could be used in the deap neural projects. But the backward propagation and forward propagation must be consist of the programmer's own code so that the programmer can exactly understand what the Neural Network is.(not allowed to use library)
